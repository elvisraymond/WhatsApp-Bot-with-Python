Hi !

I am Elvis Ray, I was able to design this Bot thanks to a resource found on the internet.

This is a WhatsApp Bot coded with Python. its purpose is to send one (or more) message(s) to one (or more) of your WhatsApp contacts. everything will depend on how you want to use it, either send a message to a single person or have it sent to several people.

for the success of this Bot, you must install the "Selenium" Library from your terminal by typing: pip install selenium

you will also need Webdriver manager, a Chrome driver, which you can freely download from the internet. I have attached it below.

Keep coding...
